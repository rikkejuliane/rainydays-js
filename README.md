### Project Overview 👀    
This project spans two course assignments: HTML & CSS and JavaScript 1. Initially, I developed a responsive, accessible website as part of the HTML & CSS course. Later, the project was extended in the JavaScript 1 course, where I integrated dynamic product data using the Rainy Days API, creating an interactive online store.

### User Stories 📃  
* As a user, I want to view a list of products on the homepage.  
* As a user, I want to filter products by category, gender, or genre.  
* As a user, I want to view a single product page with more detail.  
* As a user, I want to add a product to my basket.  
* As a user, I want to remove a product from my basket.  
* As a user, I want to view a summary of my cart on the checkout page.  
* As a user, I want to view an order-confirmation screen after checking out.

### Key Features ✨   
* **Fully Responsive Layout**  
  The site was built from scratch without frameworks, using Flexbox to ensure responsive design across all devices.

* **WCAG Compliance**  
  Accessibility was prioritized with semantic HTML, unique meta descriptions, titles, and proper heading structure for each page. The layout and interactive elements have been tested and the design passes WAVE accessibility checks.

* **Dynamic Product Fetching**  
  Products are fetched from the Rainy Days API (Noroff API) and displayed dynamically on the homepage. Users can view detailed product pages, and all content is loaded asynchronously.

* **Basket Functionality**  
  Users can add and remove items from their basket. The basket is dynamically updated and reflects on the checkout page with an order summary.

* **Error Handling & Loading Indicators**  
  Loading spinners are displayed during API calls to ensure users are aware of ongoing processes. Errors during API calls are handled gracefully, with clear feedback to the user.

* **Filter & Sort Products**  
  Users can filter products by gender, making it easier to browse through the store.
